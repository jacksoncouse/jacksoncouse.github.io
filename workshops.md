#### August 6,13, 20, and 27, 2014, from 7pm to 9pm, at the [Studio Cafe](http://www.thestudiocafe.ca/) in Ottawa

Every artist needs to photograph their artwork. While digital cameras have made taking picutres affordable and easy, getting a good image of your art is still a particularily tricky task. This workshop covers everything you need to know to produce high-quality renditions of your work for websites, grant applications, and your archives, including: a hands-on introduction to photographing 2D and 3D art, an overview of affordable lighting solutions, and a crash-course on how to manage digital images of artwork.
