I've been telling people what to do for years, but it's only recently that anyone has actually done what I told them to. Now you too can get advice from me with [Tuts+ Experts](http://experts.tutsplus.com/)!

###Mentoring

I am now available for [consultation by the hour](http://experts.tutsplus.com/products/jackson-couse) for $65 USD per hour.
 
I provide mentoring and advice for portfolio and pratice development for portrait, documentary, social-ptractice, and fine art photographers. Together we can:
 
- Develop a new project idea and get started 
- Define and refine an existing project
- See a project through to completion
- Edit your portfolio
- Develop your workflow (documentary, portrait, Photoshop, Lightroom)

Tuts+ Experts has a full moneyback gaurentee. Don't like what I have to say? No problem! You cannot lose.
