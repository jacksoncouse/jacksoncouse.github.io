I am happy to announce that I am now a mentor with [Tuts+ Experts](http://experts.tutsplus.com/)!

###Mentoring

I am available for [consultation by the hour](http://experts.tutsplus.com/products/jackson-couse) for $65 USD per hour.
 
I provide mentoring for photographers engaged with portraiture, documentary, social practice, and fine art. Even if you don't identify with one of these genres I can help move your practice forward.

Together we can:
 
- Develop a new project idea and get started 
- Define and refine an existing project
- See a project through to completion
- Edit your portfolio
- Develop your workflow (documentary, portrait, Photoshop, Lightroom)

Tuts+ Experts has a full moneyback gaurentee. Don't like what I have to say? No problem! You can't lose.
