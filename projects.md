### Sociological Walk

A public performance, social intervention, and group investigation exploring life in the Somerset-West/Chinatown neighborhood in Ottawa, Canada, where I grew up.

### Queen's Diner

For a couple of years I lived in Queens, New York, and around the corner from my house was Hugue and Sara's diner: Magazine Wells. Hugue was from Quebec, Sara from Queens.

### Home Ice

I was living in New York and feeling pretty homesick, so I started going to hockey games. _Home Ice_ was made at Aviator Arena in Brooklyn, New York, during home games of the New York Aviators, a semi-pro hockey team

### Playing House

Fait Maison (French for "home made") was an art collective and performance series that took place in a house in Gatineau, Quebec. I photographed their performances for three years.
