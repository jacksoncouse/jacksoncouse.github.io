        <p>Hi! I'm Jackson Couse, an artist from Ottawa, Canada.</p>
        <p>I make socially-engaged art: I interact with people to tell stories and make things. I work close to home, in my neighborhood, and on the street. Sometimes I work with strangers and sometimes with people I know. Making pictures, books, and videos is a way good to know people and the world. I like thinking and talking about things like identity, community, family, place, and performance.</p>
        <p>When I'm not making art projects, I run a small press devoted to publishing projects from the social landscape.</p> 
        <p>I also teach workshops - with lots of interaction and participation - in photography and film-making.</p>
        <p>If you'd like more information about me, I have a longer, more formal, third-person autobiography and an artist statement. Otherwise, please read on below for my projects and activities.</p>

        <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
        <p>I work in projects. Usually I have a few on the go at once, each taking several months to several years to complete.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3><a href="">Sociological Walk</a></h3>
            <p>The <em>Sociological Walk</em> was a performance, intervention, and investigation exploring community life in the Somerset West neighborhood in Ottawa, Canada, where I grew up.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3><a href="">Queen's Diner</a></h3>
            <p>For a couple of years I lived in Queens, New York, and around the corner from my house was Hugue and Sara's diner: Magazine Wells. Hugue was from Quebec, Sara from Queens. The diner was the best of both worlds, and my second home (and a lot of other people's, too).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3><a href="">Home Ice</a></h3>
            <p>I was living in New York and feeling pretty homesick, so I started going to hockey games. <em>Home Ice</em> was made at Aviator Arena in Brooklyn, New York, during home games of the New York Aviators, a semi-pro hockey team.</p>
          </li>
          <li>  
            <h3><a href="">Playing House</a></h3>
            <p>My first long-term project. Fait Maison (French for "home made") was an art collective and performance series that took place in a house in Gatineau, Quebec. I photographed their performances for three years.</p>
